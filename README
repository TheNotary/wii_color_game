I'm just doing a little bit of wii homebrew programming.  

::Compile Procedure

1)  You need to install devkitpro to setup your windows environment, then double clicking lesson2.pnproj should load the project with programmer's notepad (installed with devkitpro).  

2)  From there you should be able to press alt+1 to compile the .dol and .elf files.

3)  Then rename them to boot.* and copy them both over to your SD card in SD:/apps/lesson2/.  

4)  Once that's done you should be able to launch "lesson2" from the homebrew channel (version 1.1.0??? I though it had a 7 in it... I might have botched this mod a bit...)
